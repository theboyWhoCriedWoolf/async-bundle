# Running the example
The example provided is a fast way to start you playing around with `async-bundle`, trying different ways to use the component and to look through the code.

All example files are located in the example folder and are pretty self explanatory. The `index.js` is where the example application code instantiates all the views and routes.

To run the example first clone the GitHub repo to your local directory.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/theboyWhoCriedWoolf/async-bundle.git
$ cd your-cloned-directory
```

To run the example first install the dependancies either using `$ yarn` or `$ npm install`. Once all dependancies have installed run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
// or
$ yarn run dev
```

This will start the example running at `http://localhost:9000/`.
