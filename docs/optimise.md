# Optimisations with babel

There are several ways to improve performance and minimise unused code within your react applications. The most common ways is to specify the following for your .babelrc production configuration:
- [transform-react-constant-elements](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-constant-elements/)
- [transform-react-remove-prop-types](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types)
- [transform-react-inline-elements](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-inline-elements/)

There is also check out [Improve React performance with Babel](https://medium.com/doctolib-engineering/improve-react-performance-with-babel-16f1becfaa25) to help you understand what each of these tools do.
